    description %(
      The ONC certification criteria requires that patients are capable of
      choosing which FHIR resources to authorize to the application. For this
      test, the tester specifies which resources will be selected during
      authorization, and this verifies that only those resources are granted
      according to the scopes returned during the access token response.
